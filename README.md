In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving cyber landscape, vishing (voice phishing) has become a significant threat to businesses of all sizes. Cybercriminals use advanced techniques to manipulate caller IDs through call spoofing, making fraudulent calls appear legitimate. These attackers pose as trusted entities, such as banks, government agencies, or even internal company executives, tricking unsuspecting employees into revealing sensitive information or authorizing financial transactions.
This growing threat poses a major risk to companies worldwide, as traditional security measures often fail to detect these sophisticated schemes. Vishing attacks can lead to data breaches, financial fraud, and reputational damage. Without proper awareness and defenses in place, companies are vulnerable to significant financial losses and the compromise of critical information.
